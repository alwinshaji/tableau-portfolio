# 📊 Daikibo Machine Breakdown Analysis

This project is my irst Tableau dashboard, built to explore machine breakdown trends across multiple Daikibo factory locations using telemetry data from May 2021.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Daikibo operates factories in Tokyo, Osaka, Berlin, and Shenzhen. Each factory runs multiple machine types, and the objective of this dashboard was to answer two key questions:

1. Which location experienced the most machine breakdowns?
2. Which machines broke down most often at that location?

I used Tableau to visualize the data and uncover meaningful insights.
